    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I was born in Brazil and immigrated to Portugal 5 years ago, I am married and we have a dog! I have always worked with technology, I started with Auto-CAD in my first job, then I moved to help configuring CISCO devices. In Portugal I became a professional network engineer for LogicalisUS, then I discovered the web development area and I like it. Today I'm working as junior front-end while I study React and node.js to become fullstack developer </p>
